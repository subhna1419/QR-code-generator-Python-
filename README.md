This Python script generates a QR code from a user-provided link and saves it as a PNG image. It utilizes the qrcode and PIL libraries for efficient QR code creation and image manipulation.

Features:

Customizable: Adjust the QR code version (size), error correction level, box size, and border for various use cases.
Easy to Use: Simply replace "Paste here link to be encoded" with the desired URL and run the script.
Installation:

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from https://www.python.org/downloads/.

Install the required libraries using pip:
pip install qrcode Pillow
Usage:

Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script (qr_code_generator.py).

Edit the script and replace "Paste here link to be encoded" with the actual link you want to encode in the QR code.

Run the script using the following command:
python qr_code_generator.py

This will generate a QR code image named image_name.png in the same directory.

Explanation of the Code:

Imports:

qrcode: This library handles QR code generation logic.
PIL.Image: This library (often referred to as Pillow) is used for image manipulation and saving.
QR Code Creation:

code_img = qr.QRCode(...): Initializes a QR code object with desired parameters:

version=1: Sets the QR code size (version 1 is the smallest).
error_correction=qr.constants.ERROR_CORRECT_H: Sets the highest error correction level for better data recovery from potential damage.
box_size=10: Defines the size of each module (black/white square) in pixels.
border=5: Sets the number of white border modules around the QR code.
.add_data("..."): Adds the user-provided link (replace with your actual link) to the QR code.

.make(fit=True): Generates the QR code data ensuring it fits within the specified version.

Image Generation:

.make_image(fill_color="black", back_color="red"): Creates a QR code image using the make_image method.
fill_color="black": Sets the color of the QR code modules (black squares by default).
back_color="red": Sets the background color of the image (red by default).
Saving the Image:

.save("image_name.png"): Saves the generated image as a PNG file named image_name.png.
Additional Notes:

Experiment with different version numbers, error correction levels, box sizes, and border values to customize the appearance and functionality of your QR code.
Consider using error handling mechanisms to prevent potential issues with invalid URLs or unexpected inputs.
You can extend the script to accept command-line arguments for user-specified parameters like the output filename, link, and image format.
